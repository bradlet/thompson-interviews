# Event-Driven-Architecture Supporting Infrastructure

## Context
"Company Blank is undergoing a transition from a monolithic architecture to a more modular, service-oriented design, and its engineering organization is reinforcing its event-driven architecture principles. Imagine you're joining a small, focused team tasked with extracting a well-defined piece of functionality from the monolith into a standalone domain service. This new service will operate within an isolated environment (a separate GCP project) and will communicate via Google Pub/Sub. While the long-term goal is to establish a fully decoupled event ecosystem, the immediate priority is to integrate with a set of existing Pub/Sub topicsâ€”while extending the system with new topics to support evolving product requirements."
